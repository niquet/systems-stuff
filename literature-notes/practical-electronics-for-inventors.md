## Introduction to Electronics

- Chart lays out an overview of the basic elements that go into designing practical electrical gadgets + represents the information you will find in the book
- This chapter introduces the basic elements
- Theory involves voltage, current, resistance, capacitance, inductance, and laws and theorems that help predict the size and direction of voltages and currents within circuits
- Passive components include resistors, capacitors, inductors, transformers
- Discrete passive circuits include current-limiting networks, voltage dividers, filter circuits, attenuators, etc.
- Discrete active devices (which are built from semiconductor materials) consist mainly of diodes (one-way current flow gates) and transistors (electrically controlled switches/amplifiers)
- Discrete active/passive circuits include rectifiers (ac-to-dc converters), amplifiers, oscillators, modulators, mixers, and voltage regulators
- Input/output (I/O) devices
