# Microcontrollers

- Integrated circuits (IC) that combine a microprocessor, memory, and input/output (I/O) periphals on a single chip
- Designed for embedded applications
- Popular microcontrollers include AVR, PIC, STM32, MSP430, ESP32
- Choosing the right microntroller involves assessing application requirements, processing power, memory needs, and input/ouput (I/O) capabilities
- Consider ease of use, cost, reliability, availability, future expansion

## Gettin started

- Microcontroller-based circuit design
- Microcontrollers are small, versatile, inexpensive devices that can be programmed
- Microcontrollers have a long list of applications
- A microcontroller is an integrated circuit (IC) device used for controlling other portions of an electronic system, usually via a microprocessor unit (MPU), memory, and some peripherals
- These devices are optimized for embedded applications that require both processing functionality and agile, responsive interaction with digital, analog, or electromechanical components
- Combines a digital processor and digital memory with additional hardware that is specifically designed to help the microcontroller interact with other components
